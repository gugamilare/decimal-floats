 A rounding mode function will be called whenever there are
some digits (zero or non zero) to be discarded. These situations
coincide with the times that the ROUND condition may be raised.

 This function must accept three arguments.

  - DISCARDED-DIGITS, a number representing the relative value
    of the digits that will be discarded.
    Its value will be greater than, equal to or smaller than 5,
    if the discarded digits represent a value greater than, exactly equal
    or smaller than half (0.5) of the value of a one in the next left position.
    For instance, to round 1.005 to either 1.00 or 1.01,
    DISCARDED-DIGITS would be 5; to round 1.006 or 1.00999,
    it would be some value greater than 5 and smaller than 9
    (i.e. 6 (in case of underflow, see below), 7 or 8);
    and to round 1.004 or 1.00001, DISCARDED-DIGITS would be some value
    smaller than 4 and greater than 0
    (i.e. 1 (in case of underflow, see below), 2 or 3).

    If DISCARDED-DIGITS is 9, it means an overflow occurred.
    If DISCARDED-DIGITS is 0, only zero digits are being discarded.

  - LAST-DIGIT, an integer which represents the value of the
    last non-discarded digit. It is 9 in case of overflow.

  - SIGNED-P, a boolean which tells if the number is negative.

 Only one value need to be returned, ROUND-UP-P a boolean. If it is true,
the number will be rounded away from 0. If it is NIL, the discarded digits
will be ignored.

 In the case of overflow (when DISCARDED-DIGITS is 9), if ROUND-UP-P is true,
the rounded number will be infinite with the same size as the number;
if ROUND-UP-P is NIL, the largest representable number in the current
precision, with the same sign of the number, is returned.

 In the special case where DISCARDED-DIGITS is 1, if ROUND-UP-P is NIL,
the value returned will be a zero; if it is true, the number will be
rounded to the smallest representable non-zero number in the current
precision with the same sign of the number.

Examples: (plusp discarded-digits) => :round-up (rounds away from zero)
          nil => :round-down (rounds toward zero)
          (>= discarded-digits 5) => :round-half-up
