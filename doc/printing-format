 A printing format function should take three arguments:

  - EXPONENT, the exponent of the number, i.e., the exponent to be used if all
    digits are printed as an integer. (In particular, if EXPONENT is
    non-negative, the number is integral).
    It will be 0 if number is special (i.e. infinity or NaN)

  - ADJUSTED-EXPONENT, the adjusted exponent of the number, i.e., the exponent
    to be used if only one digit is placed before the dot ('.'). It will be 0 if
    number is a NaN or 1 if number is infinity.

  - DIGITS, the number of significant digits to be printed (including zeroes to
    the right). It will be 0 if and only if the number is special.

 They have the mathematical relation

   EXPONENT + (DIGITS - 1) = ADJUSTED-EXPONENT

 and all are given to make manipulation easiear.

 This function must return these five values, in order:

  - PRINTED-EXPONENT, the exponent to be printed (after the 'E' character) or
    NIL not to use exponencial notation. This value is ignored if the number to
    be printed is special.

  - DOT-POSITION, the position of the dot ('.').
    If positive, it tells how many digits will be printed before the dot,
    including zeroes if necessary.
    If it is zero, a single zero digit will be printed before the dot.
    If it is negative, a zero digit will be printed, then the decimal dot, then
    (- DOT-POSITION) zero digits will be printed before the digits of the number.
    The dot is ommited if dot-position is NIL.
    In all of the situations above, 
    This value is ignored if the number to be printed is special.

  - PRINT-PLUS-P, tells if the sign '+' must be shown if the number is positive
    (or a positive zero, or an unsigned NaN). Its possible values are:
    NIL - don't print any '+' signs;
    :COEFFICIENT - print a '+' before the coefficient if it is positive;
    :EXPONENT - print a '+' before the exponent if it is positive;
    T - print '+' in both the exponent and coefficient.

  - OMIT-MINUS-P, tells if the sign '-' must be *omitted* if the number is
    negative (or a negative zero, or a signed NaN). Its possible values are:
    NIL - print a '-' in the cofefficient and exponent where applicable;
    :COEFFICIENT - omit the '-' before the coefficient if it is negative;
    :EXPONENT - omit the '-' before the exponent if it is negative;
    T - omit the '-' in both the exponent and coefficient.

 If the printed number must represent the actual number, the following relation

   (or DOT-POSITION DIGITS) - 1 + PRINTED-EXPONENT = ADJUSTED-EXPONENT

should be respected. Also, if the precision must be preserved, then DOT-POSITION
must either less or equal than DIGITS or nil.

 These relations are satisfyied only by :SCIENTIFIC, :ENGINEERING, :EXPONENCIAL,
:SIGNED-DIGITS+EXPONENT and :DIGITS+EXPONENT among the built-in formats.

 Examples: ;; print the number in exponencial notation with optional sign
           (values adjusted-exponent 1) => :exponencial notation
           ;; prints three digits before the sign (e.g. 123.456E78)
           (values adjusted-exponent 3) => :exponencial notation
           ;; prints only the digits of the number
           (values nil nil nil t) => :unsigned-digits
